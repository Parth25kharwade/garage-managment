# üöó Garage Management System (Backend)

This project provides a robust backend solution for managing the operations of an automobile garage or service center. Built with **Spring Boot**, it offers a set of RESTful APIs for handling customers, vehicles, service appointments, parts inventory, and billing.

## üöÄ Features

This system is designed to streamline key garage operations, offering the following capabilities:

  * **Customer & Vehicle Management:** Store customer details and link them to multiple vehicles with service history.
  * **Service & Appointment Tracking:** Create, schedule, and track the status of service appointments (e.g., Pending, In-Progress, Completed).
  * **Parts Inventory:** Manage stock levels, pricing, and suppliers for spare parts.
  * **Service Order/Job Card Generation:** Automatically generate comprehensive service orders that include labor costs and parts used.
  * **Authentication & Security:** Secure access using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user login and authorization (e.g., Admin vs. Mechanic roles).
  * **RESTful API:** Clear, standards-compliant API endpoints for easy frontend integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The core of the application is built on modern, enterprise-grade Java technologies.

| Category | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **Spring Boot** | The primary framework for building the REST API. |
| **Language** | **Java 17+** | The programming language used for the codebase. |
| **Database** | **MySQL / PostgreSQL** | Database connector for persistence (configurable via `application.properties`). |
| **Security** | **Spring Security & JWT** | Handles authentication and role-based access control. |
| **ORM** | **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate** | For object-relational mapping and database interactions. |
| **Build Tool** | **Maven** | Dependency management and build automation. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the backend server running locally.

### Prerequisites

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
  * **Maven 3.6+**
  * **A running database instance** (e.g., MySQL 8.0+)
  * **Git**

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parth25kharwade/garage-managment.git
cd garage-managment
```

### 2\. Configure the Database

Create a new database for the application and update the connection details.

  * **Create Database:**

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE garage_db;
    ```

  * **Update Configuration:**
    Create an `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in `src/main/resources` (or modify the existing one) with your database and JWT secret:

    ```properties
    # Database Configuration
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/garage_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    # JWT Security Configuration
    jwt.secret=YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JWT_SECRET_KEY
    ```

### 3\. Build the Project

Use Maven to compile the code and resolve dependencies.

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 4\. Run the Application

Start the Spring Boot server. The application will typically run on `http://localhost:8080`.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## üìö API Endpoints (Conceptual)

The API is accessible at the base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1` (or similar, depending on the controller path).

| Endpoint Category | Method | Path | Description | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | `POST` | `/auth/register` | Register a new user (first user may be ADMIN). | Public |
| | `POST` | `/auth/login` | Authenticate and receive a JWT token. | Public |
| **Customers** | `POST` | `/customers` | Add a new customer. | Authenticated |
| | `GET` | `/customers/{id}` | Retrieve a specific customer and their vehicles. | Authenticated |
| **Vehicles** | `POST` | `/vehicles` | Register a new vehicle. | Authenticated |
| | `GET` | `/vehicles/search` | Search vehicles by VIN or License Plate. | Authenticated |
| **Service Orders** | `POST` | `/services` | Create a new service job card. | Authenticated |
| | `PUT` | `/services/{id}/status` | Update the service status (e.g., `COMPLETED`). | Authenticated |
| **Inventory** | `GET` | `/parts` | Retrieve the list of all available parts. | Authenticated |
| | `POST` | `/parts` | Add a new part to inventory. | Authenticated (Admin) |
